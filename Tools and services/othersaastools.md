#Other software as a service tools
This guidance covers the many hundreds of sites offering off the shelf solutions for newsletters, forms, events and more.

##Guidance
If you're looking for a newsletter sending service, a way of creating a standalone form or any other web based service, it's very tempting to do a Google search and opt for the best off the sheld solution you find.

We don't currently recommend that you do this as it may lead to technical or security issues in the future. It would be catastrophic, for example, if users' names and addresses collected by a form ended up being posted on the internet.

If you need a web solution, always contact us first. It may be that an off the shelf solution will work for you, but we want to make sure that you get the best advice possible.
