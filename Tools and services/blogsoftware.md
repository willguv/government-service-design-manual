#Blog software
This guidance looks at blogs and how they can be used to communicate with tailored audiences and receive useful feedback from them.

##What are blogs?
According to [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog), blogs are discussion or information websites consisting of text entries (called "posts") typically displayed latest first.

Blogs first become popular in the late 1990s and enabled anyone to publish a website - no technical knowledge necessary. There are now over 150 million public blogs around the world.

##How to start a blog
First, get in touch with us. We're in the middle of procuring a blog platform that any Government department will be able to use. It will be based an industry standard platform such as Wordpress, Blogger or Tumblr and publishing will be extremely straightfoward.

We will assess your need for a blog and, if approved, set one up for you. We will also provide simple to follow blogging instructions and a style guide.

To begin with, blogs launched via our platform will follow a common design. Later, we will look at offering more tailored designs.

The blog platform will also be built to work with GOV.UK, providing content feeds that can be incorporated within selected GOV.UK pages - more detail to follow when we have it.

##How not to start a blog
It's very easy to start a blog outside of our platform. We don't reccommend you do this as you may run into technical or other issues later on. If you're collecting user data, for example, you need to be aware of how it's stored and how secure your service is. The last thing you need is for names and addresses of contributors or users commenting on your blog to be leaked on to the internet.

Instead get in touch with us. We can deliver an easy to use blog that's secure, leaving you to focus on creating compelling content for your users.

##Writing a great blog post
We asked some great Government bloggers for their secret recipe and here's what they said:

* Show humility
* Only blog when you have something useful or original to say
* Tell an interesting story readers can relate to
* Keep your posts short and to the point
* Don't let months go by without posting
* Acknowledge others
* Avoid jargon

Also consider the sector you're publishing in. Check out who else is blogging, what they're blogging about and the kind of posts that receive comments from other users.

##Allowing comments or not
As a Government blog, it's good form to allow comments wherever possible. Comments provide useful feedback, could provide ideas for future blog posts and inform your team's thinking.

Beware of [trolls](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_(Internet)) looking to disrupt normal discussions. Here's a [few tips on dealing with them](http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/jun/12/how-to-deal-with-trolls) courtesy of the Guardian.
